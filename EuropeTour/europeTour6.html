            <p>From Lubeck the plan changed at the last minute again. The very original plan had been to continue up the Jutland peninsula and cross the border into Denmark near Flensburg Germany. Already I had adapted it, coming through Hamburg and planning to continue north east onto Fehmarn island taking the ferry directly across to Denmark. Once in Lubeck though the idea of swinging through Sweden on the way to Denmark seemed quite cool and so I took the ferry from just north of Lubeck to Malmo Sweden.

            <p>A generous Warm Showers host Alice put me up after getting in late to Malmo for the night. This was especially appreciated as it turned out to be a rainy night. The time in Sweden was short biking up along the coast to Helsingborg but extremely pleasant. I camped one night at a unique lean-to built by local architecture students on the ocean, on the other side I could see the Danish coast I would soon be traveling along. I had my first campfire of the trip which I had not realized I had missed so much. It seems like the Scandinavian grocery stores all have these pick your own candy stations which I have been making great use of.</p>

            <p>The ferry to Denmark was quick and included a nice view of Helsingor as we came in. Cycling out through the city from the harbour I knew I was going to love Denmark. For the evening I headed over to Esrum So, Denmark's second largest lake for the evening. Another night camping on the water was well worth going a bit out of the way before heading to Copenhagen.</p>

            <p>Copenhagen has been by far my favorite city so far. I've spent a lot of time at their public library the "Black Diamond" to work on upcoming trip plans. All of the waterways through the city give it a nice open feeling and are a nice place to sit with a beer in the evening. The water is even clean enough to go for a swim in which I did not once but twice, a real treat in the middle of the city and obviously the locals agree based on the turn out.</p>
