            <p>The Ferry landed in Dunkirk, France and right away I was off towards the Belgian border (after picking up a baguette of course). I had booked a hostel there in the first town after the French border. After a much needed shower I enjoyed an evening on the beach and my first taste of Belgian beer.

            <p>The next day I biked the coast of Belgium to the Netherlands, camping options were slim in this area but thankfully a Warmshowers host was willing to put up in Zeeland in the Netherlands. Froukja and Paul were very welcoming fellow cycle tourists who had done a year-long tour though the USA not too long ago. It was a pleasure to get to chat with them and meet their neighbors. Before heading out they treated me to a traditional Dutch breakfast, chocolate sprinkles on buttered bread (or as I know them "jimmies"). Later that day I noticed my bike's smaller front sprocket was starting to rattle. I had lost 3/5 screws holding it on and the remaining two were very loose. I tightened the remaining two back down just to hold it in place, though I dared not use it. Luckily the Netherlands is flat enough that it wasn't needed for quite a while. I suspect the majority of the loosening had happened back during the last two days in the UK which were exceptionally bumpy and hilly.

            <p>The cycling infrastructure in Holland is really quite something, and it is cool to see so many people out cycling even outside of the cities. I enjoyed a few days of easy cruising through the flat countryside. The numerous lift bridges and small ferries for river and canal crossing were a treat every time. The smaller family run campgrounds were nice for getting away from the loud caravan parks and I enjoyed trying the local beer as well as more of the more well known Belgian beers. I had been wanting to try the Chouffe Cherry for some time after seeing it in Total Wine at home and it was not disappointing, especially after many days cycling in a row.

            <p>Eventually I made it to Germany where my original plan had been to follow the coastline towards Flensburg and into Denmark. This changed when I saw the ferries you could take from the Lubeck area and instead I cut across through Hamburg and Lubeck to the opposite side of the continent. Upon reaching Lubeck I finally took a rest day after 11 consecutive days of cycling (since leaving Oxford) to recuperate and plan the next leg of the trip.
