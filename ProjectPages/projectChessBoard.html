                <h2>Alder and Walnut Chess Board</h2>
                <p>I was a bit nervous about doing solid wood tiles with no border breaking the glue joints during seasonal humidity changes. Its been around for a full year and hasn't been an issue though. The base it is sitting on is 1/4" lightweight MDF so I wouldn't expect it to hold it togehter if the pices wanted to seperate. </p>

                <p>I prefer the look of a borderless chessboard, the undercut the bottom edge to give it a sort of floating look. Eventually decided to add a riser to lift it a big higer upoff the ground.</p>

                <p>Not all of the tile corners align perfectly but from a distance it's hard to tell.</p>

                <p>Though I do have an old wood lathe taking up space in the garage I wasn't quite ready to pump out all the pieces myself. I didn't do to too much reaserch on typical board sizes before starting the project and my tile dimensions ended up kind of in the middle of common sizes. Sourcing quality pieces that fit the board well was tricky but I'm happy with these.</p>
