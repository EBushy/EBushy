                <p>
                    The Underground Movement is the official newsletter of the Central Connecticut Grotto, which is the state's largest active caving community. Our newsletter includes content from local members and the caving community at large, and is enjoyed by many.
                    <br><br>
                    After getting more interested in caving this past spring I wanted to try my hand at making my own gear. My article about sewing a bag from scratch is on page 11, its function is benefited greatly by Danny Brass's graceful intro on page 3 in <i>From the Editor's Desk</i>.
