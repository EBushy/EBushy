                <p>Since middle school I have loved tinkering around in my Dad's small shop and have come to make it in a small part my own. Since then I have had to oppertunity to work larger endeavors in a variety of domains helping to build new experiences and approaches. Learining to operate manual machine tools, CNC mills, weld, smith, and build electrical and sytems has alowed me to expand the scope of my projects significantly.</p>

                <p>For Christmas of 2022 I gifted my younger brother a chess board. We often play together, especially over holdays and family trips. The tiles are made of walnut and alder for the dark and light tiles respectively. The pieces were puchased and seem to fit the scale of the board nicely.  </p>

                <p>This is a simple forging setup I fabricated in my highschools machine shop. The forge itself is a cast iron brake drum with angle iron legs and steel top to manage coal. The anvil is just a heavy steel scrap with an odd rounded part which works nice for more agressive drawing operations, it can be used somewhat like a tradditional horn though without as much clearence underneath. </p>

                <p>This is a simple incense stick holder I made for a friend's birthday. Despite how simple it is manufacturing the features on top was really interesting. I used an end mill and router bit in the drill press to carve the two cuts that defined the catch.</p>

                <p>The ebony handle to my mother's large kitchen knife was starting to fall apart, and though it was not of extraordinary quality to begin with I made a simple replacement out of walnut. I also etched a simple family logo I designed into the blade.</p>
