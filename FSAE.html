                <p>UConn Formula SAE is a self led student team that develops and builds a formula style race car. They compete at the SAE sponsored event held at Michigan International Speedway every year, this has over 120 teams from around the world.
                </p><p></p>
                The team with all of its members and contributors has become a monumental force in my growth over the past 4 years. For that and the opportunity to help lead the team as Chief Engineer for the 2021-2022 season I am eternally grateful.

                <p>This is the first major design project that I took on at the start of my sophmore year. The objective was to deacrease the weight of the suspension rocker whitch is a component that redirects forces between the pullrod, damper, and anit-roll bar.</p>
